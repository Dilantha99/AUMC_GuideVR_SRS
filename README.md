## 🧠 What is AUMC GuideVR?

**AUMC GuideVR** is a visionary software concept designed to revolutionize how students, faculty, and visitors navigate the Air University Multan Campus — through an immersive **Virtual Reality-based navigation system**.

Instead of relying on traditional maps or asking for directions, users can **explore the entire campus in VR**, view **360° locations**, and **navigate both indoors and outdoors** with intelligent visual guidance.

> ❗ This project is not a software prototype — it is a professionally documented **IEEE-compliant Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** crafted as part of our SRE course to simulate real-world software engineering processes.

## 🚀 Key Features (Planned in SRS)

- 🔍 **Search & Locate**: Instantly find classrooms, labs, offices, or blocks.
- 🧭 **VR Indoor Navigation**: Step-by-step visual guidance through virtual scenes.
- 🌐 **Drone View Mode**: A top-down campus layout with clickable buildings.
- 🏫 **360° Exploration**: Explore major campus areas with panoramic views.
- 📍 **Faculty Finder**: Locate departments, offices, and professors with ease.
- 💾 **Bookmark Favorite Spots**: Save and revisit frequently accessed locations.
- 📏 **Distance Calculator**: Know how far you are from your destination.
- 🖱️ **Touch & Orientation Support**: Smooth interaction for mobile and desktop.
- 🛡️ **Security & Performance Focused**: Defined constraints and compliance protocols.
